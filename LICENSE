OpenSPV is the reference implementation of all of the protocols of the Social
Bitcoin Web (SBW).

Every commit to OpenSPV is open to consortium members but closed to outsiders.

For every commit to OpenSPV, the commit changes to the OpenBSV license one year
after the commit was made.

Consortium members are added and removed at the sole discretion of HeartMail
Inc. Any consortium member who is removed retains the license for the software
up through the latest commit before they were removed.

The full list of consortium members are:

Thus, there are two periods for every commit:

- The closed period.
- The open period.

During the closed period:

- Consortium members are free to sell or license proprietary software that
  bundles OpenSPV inside as a dependency.
- Consortium members are not free to sell or license OpenSPV as an isolated
  package.

During open period, the license changes to OpenBSV. The text of the OpenBSV
license follows:
