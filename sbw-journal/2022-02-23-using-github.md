Dear Social Bitcoin Web Consortium Member,

We covered an overview of the protocols two days ago at the second SBWC meeting.

The most important early protocols revolve around identity and include:

* Authentication
* Filter services
* Key logging and revocation
* Govt ID / KYC
* Key derivation
* Two Factor Friend (2FF)

The recording of the meeting is available here:

You can also watch this relevant discussion between BriteVue and HeartMail and Two Factor Friend and Filter Services, and why these protocols need to be finished very early on and why we are working on them now:

We are already using GitHub to make contributions.

Since the meeting, we have already updated the protocols substantially thanks to Connor who has contributed a draft protocol for filter services and related protocols.

You can create pull requests to change the protocols or software. See the pull request from Connor for an example:

https://github.com/openspv/openspv/pull/7

You can also create issues to discuss the protocols and software.

See the issues here:

Deggen is researching the Matrix protocol as a possible way to integrate basic social features into our protocols:

GitHub will be used for all protocol specifications and software.

Not all consortium members have signed up for GitHub yet. If you are not on GitHub, please sign up to be able to contribute.

Hona will be used for overall project management. We will send more information on using Hona soon.

For now, you should sign up for Hona at hona.io.
