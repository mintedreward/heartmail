Dear Social Bitcoin Web Consortium Member,

This week we have made substantial progress towards the authentication protocol, which is a prerequisite for many of the other protocols we intend to launch.

Britevue already has a working proof-of-concept, and the OpenSPV repo now has a paymail implementation which is a part of the authentication protocol.

The first major milestone is SPV after which we will do media, contracts and rights, DHTs, etc.

Thank you very much to Connor, Dylan, Marcel, Dave, Deggen, and others who have already made contributions.

We have a meeting today. Due to repeated calendar issues, I have deleted the invite and sent it again with a new Zoom link. I will have to send one invite per week from now on and I will not be relying on recurring invites.

On the agenda for today are:

- IP issues and how your business will earn money and how the SBWC will not

- Informal NDA: Please do not discuss anything that happens in this group with the outside. If you want someone to know something, you should invite them by contacting me and asking that I add them to the group.

- Progress towards authentication protocol

- Javascript / typescript coding conventions

Today we will be breaking out into working groups for the first time.

The working groups are:

- DHTs
- Identity
- Law
- Marketing
- Media
- Payments
- UI/UX

If you are interested in one of these subjects, be ready to choose the correct working group.

The time of the meeting is 6pm CT. Please rely on the calendar invite for your local time conversion.

The Zoom link for the meeting at 6pm CT is:
