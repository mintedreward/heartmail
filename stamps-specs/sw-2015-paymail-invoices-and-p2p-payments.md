SW 2015: Paymail invoice and P2P payments
========================================

Dependencies

* SW 2001: Paymail

Introduction
------------

This is the idea of sending a transaction p2p using paymails.

stephen@unisot.io generates an invoice
ryan@heartmail.com sees the invoice
ryan@heartmail.com sends a payment to stephen@unisot.io with the invoice number, paying the invoice

We can look at the p2p transaction protocol created by Money Button & Handcash or we can look at BIP 270 to specify this.
