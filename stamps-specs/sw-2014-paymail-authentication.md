SW 2014: Email2 authentication with revocation
==============================================

Dependencies
------------

* SW 2005: Email2 authentication without revocation
* SW 2013: Email2 signatures with revocation

Introduction
------------

Logging in with your email2 involves producing a signature. In the simple
formulation, SW 4 ("without revocation"), we do not require using a
"revocation-enabled" email2 signature. In this formulation we do. This type of
authentication is the most secure and robust possible.
