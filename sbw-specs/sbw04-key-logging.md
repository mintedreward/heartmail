SBW4: Key Logging and Revocation (Fixing PKI)
=============================================

We can fix PKI by logging paymail name and key registrations on the blockchain.
When a key is lost or stolen, the key can be revoked by broadcasting a
revocation transaction.

Note that we can fix:
- DNS
- HTTPS
- Paymail
using this technology. This technology fixes *all* PKI when deployed by our
businesses.
