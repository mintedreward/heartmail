SBW5: Two Factor Friend (2FF)
=============================

We will completely eliminate the use of passwords and mnemonics. Our authentication system will be more user-friendly than any existing system.

The way this works is that the user’s master key will be backed up to a server, e.g. heartmail.com. The key to decrypt this will be shared with one or more friends. The user can log in by retrieving the encrypted key from the server and the decryption key from at least one friend.

This protocol eliminates the need for password or mnemonic for log in while allowing the user to manage their own keys. This completely solves the key management issue in a manner compliant with the lightest regulations.

This protocol is called “Two Factor Friend” (2FF).

HeartMail has invented this patentable protocol and is sharing this for free to the ecosystem unpatented because it is better for all of us if this if it is freely available.
