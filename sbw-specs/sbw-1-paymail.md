SBW 1: Paymail
==============

Most SBW protocols are extensions to paymail. In this initial protocol, we
simply copy the original paymail protocol spec into the SBW.

Note: We should never support pay-to-address. We should only support
peer-to-peer transactions. That is to say, from Day 1 of the launch of SBW /
OpenSPV, all transactions are sent to the recipient and not simply broadcast to
the miners.
