* SBW 2005: Email2 authentication without revocation
* SBW 2013: Email2 signatures with revocation

Introduction
------------

Logging in with your email2 involves producing a signature. In the simple
formulation, SBW 4 ("without revocation"), we do not require using a
"revocation-enabled" email2 signature. In this formulation we do. This type of
authentication is the most secure and robust possible.
