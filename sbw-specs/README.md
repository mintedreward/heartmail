Social Bitcoin Web (SBW) Protocol Specifications
================================================

All drafts and published specifications are in this directory in the form of a
markdown file.

All specs are numbered starting with 1. If SBWX depends on SBWY, then X > Y.
e.g., SBW10 can use SBW1 - SBW9 as a dependency.

Protocol specifications that depend on each other should either be merged into
one spec or broken up into a hierarchy to follow the above rule.

In other words, the specs form a directed acyclic graph.

Specs should always include:
- Number
- Name
- Status (Draft or Published)
- Authors
- Full text of the specification

A specification is not final until the OpenSPV implementation of the
specification is finished and published publicly on the web.
