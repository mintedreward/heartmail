SBW Protocol Specifications
===========================

All protocol draft and final specifications are in this directory in the form of
a markdown file.

Ordering
--------

All specs are numbered starting with 1. If SBW X depends on SBW Y, then X > Y.
e.g., SBW 10 can use SBW 1 - SBW 9 as a dependency.

Protocol specifications that depend on each other should either be merged into
one spec or broken up into a hierarchy to follow the above rule.

In other words, the specs form a directed acyclic graph.
