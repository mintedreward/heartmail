ESW 114: Media Transfer
===========================

Send videos, images, articles, and other types of media from server to server
using an extension to email2.

This is a type of mail and can be seen as a media extension to email. e.g.,
ryan@heartmail.com sends a video presentation to stephen@unisot.io and
*@elas.digital.
