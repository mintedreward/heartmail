        <h2>Why I Deleted My Twitter Account</h2>

        <p>Nov 8, 2021</p>

        <p>I had over 26,000 followers on Twitter and could easily get attention by tweeting something. However, Twitter made me feel disgusting every time I opened it up. Even though I tried only to look at my own profile, they put advertisements for other tweets that I don't want to see everywhere. I found it very easy to click through and start viewing other people's tweets on Twitter. It is psychologically addictive and hard to look away. However, I gained nothing and only cringed every time I looked at it. I even fell for a scam in the past week and had to do an hour's worth of research to convince myself it was just a scam and calm down. The scam was just a website promoting a false claim in order to get clicks to scam advertisers. How irritating.</p>

        <p>Twitter does not promote the truth. Twitter promotes whatever creates engagement. What Twitter promotes is false about 50% of the time. It is completely unreliable as a way to learn about what is going on in the world. I do not agree with Twitter's principles and do not want to continue to harm my own psychology by using it. Furthermore, even though I stand a lot to gain by putting advertisements for my work on there, I do not want to continue to promote Twitter itself by advertising my work with it, because it forces other people to look at Twitter just to see what I am up to. The only ethical thing to do is to delete my profile and to stop promoting it completely.</p>

        <p>I know a small number of people have bookmarked my personal web page and will see this message. All new updates will be on my personal home page first, and on other social platforms second. Please come back from time to time to see new content and see what I am up to.</p>

        <p>I am serious about the Social Bitcoin Web (SBW). It is bigger than you think. I will publish more technical information soon. Please get your personal web page going. I am going to monitor the previously mentioned links for updates. Let's link to each other and build a better web where we are all in control over our own identity and content.</p>

        <p>If you want to contact me, my email address is my first name at my personal domain name dot com.</p>

        <h2>The Purpose and Value of Corporations</h2>

        <p>Nov 7, 2021</p>
        
        <p>If you are going to engage with other people in business, sometimes things go wrong. When they go wrong, corporations enable you to limit liability.</p>

        <p>Imagine you provide a service like a hosted Bitcoin wallet. You take every precaution to secure your users' funds. Unfortunately, one day your service is hacked, and your users' funds are stolen.</p>

        <p>So long as you followed the law at every step, your users can sue your corporation for their funds, but they cannot sue you personally. This means while your corporation may go bankrupt in order to pay out to your users, you do not personally go bankrupt. This is the entire reason why corporations exist.</p>

        <p>Creating a corporation is not expensive. Every person in the world who engages with others economically has every reason to create a corporation. Even if you are an employee of someone else's corporation, you may have other business interests outside of your employer and you should create a corporation for all your business activity.</p>

        <p>Best practices for creating a corporation depend on what country you live in and where you do business. For US companies that intend to go public, you should create a Delaware C corp. For US corporations that do not want to go public and want to minimize taxes, you should use an LLC, and you should research which state is best for you. You do not have to incorporate in the same state where you live, but you do need to register there. For outside the US, there are countless options. You do not necessarily need to incorporate in your home country, but you likely need to register in your home country.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.coasian.com/">Coasian Inc.</a> is a Delaware C corp because I want the option to go public in the future.</p>

        <h2>First Links in the Social Bitcoin Web</h2>

        <p>Nov 6, 2021</p>

        <p>The Social Bitcoin Web (SBW) is a new social network where everybody is a sovereign individual. The following individuals have agreed to be linked from my personal web page to begin building the SBW.</p>

        <p><a href="https://bigbadbrad.com">Brad Meinert</a>. Growth Hacker.</p>

        <p><a href="https://will.townsend.io">Will Townsend</a>. I'm a human being who writes software, enjoys music, and lives in Vancouver BC ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.</p>

        <p><a href="https://sebastianvanti.com">Sebastian Vanti</a> es un artista chileno - holandÃ©s.</p>

        <p><a href="https://kurtwuckertjr.com">Kurt Wuckert Jr.</a> Bitcoin Historian. Fighter. Family Man.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.ryanwold.net">Ryan Wold</a>. I'm grateful to be a son, husband, and father.</p>

        <p><a href="http://framore.net">Framore</a>. This site is how I believe the internet should be: not the products of big corporations but various sites curated by each user.</p>

        <p><a href="https://february.sg">Stephan M. February</a>. Bitcoin developer.</p>

        <p><a href="https://bryandaugherty.net">Bryan Daugherty</a>. Technology solution consultant.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.diddywheldon.co.uk">Diddy Wheldon</a>. Actress, Artist, B.Msc., BSV.</p>

        <p><a href="https://mrz1818.com">Mr Z</a>. "The majority see the obstacles; the few see the objectives; history records the successes of the latter, while oblivion is the reward of the former."</p>

        <p>The SBW is based on the web, Bitcoin, and social networks. It uses new extensions to <a href="https://www.bsvalias.org">paymail</a> to make a true market of information. It is just getting started. To join the network, purchase a domain name for yourself, set up a personal web page, and get linked into it.</p>

        <h2>Introducing the Social Bitcoin Web</h2>

        <p>Nov 1, 2021</p>

        <p>The <b>Social Bitcoin Web (SBW)</b> is a set of protocol extensions to Paymail, Bitcoin, and the Web that connects real-world identity (private by default, of course) to electronic cash payments over the internet. This makes it possible to have a true market of information. The economics-first model fixes many issues, most especially the subversive misallocation of attention caused by the overreliance on ad-funded media (social and traditional). We will fix the attention issue first. Then we will fix every other issue.</p>

        <p>Weâ€™re going to build the Social Bitcoin Web together publicly on social media. Big Tech companies like Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), Twitter, and so on, will be able to follow along and pivot their business models over time. But our network will have many opportunities to outcompete them if we can move faster than they do.</p>

        <p>Step 1. <b>Buy a domain name for yourself</b>. Your domain name should have a TLD corresponding to your country. If you live in Spain, your domain name should be [yourname].es, for instance.</p>

        <p>Step 2. <b>Host a personal web page on your domain name that you fully control and that serves as the entry point to your public persona</b>. You donâ€™t have to share everything about your private life. Just share the information you want. Take pride in your personal web page. This is your new profile (not your Instagram).</p>

        <p>You should be able to get these things going in one day. If youâ€™re busy, no more than one week. Remember you can iterate. The first version doesnâ€™t have to be perfect. You can make it better tomorrow.</p>

        <p>My domain name is <a href="https://www.ryanxcharles.com/">ryanxcharles.com</a>. Bookmark my web page. Youâ€™ll notice this message is replicated across my web page, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Medium, and LinkedIn. Please share a link to your web page in the comments to this message on social media. I will link the ones I like from my web page. This is the beginning.</p>
