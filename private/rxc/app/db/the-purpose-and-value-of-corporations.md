If you are going to engage with other people in business, sometimes things go wrong. When they go wrong, corporations enable you to limit liability.

Imagine you provide a service like a hosted Bitcoin wallet. You take every precaution to secure your users' funds. Unfortunately, one day your service is hacked, and your users' funds are stolen.

So long as you followed the law at every step, your users can sue your corporation for their funds, but they cannot sue you personally. This means while your corporation may go bankrupt in order to pay out to your users, you do not personally go bankrupt. This is the entire reason why corporations exist.

Creating a corporation is not expensive. Every person in the world who engages with others economically has every reason to create a corporation. Even if you are an employee of someone else's corporation, you may have other business interests outside of your employer and you should create a corporation for all your business activity.

Best practices for creating a corporation depend on what country you live in and where you do business. For US companies that intend to go public, you should create a Delaware C corp. For US corporations that do not want to go public and want to minimize taxes, you should use an LLC, and you should research which state is best for you. You do not have to incorporate in the same state where you live, but you do need to register there. For outside the US, there are countless options. You do not necessarily need to incorporate in your home country, but you likely need to register in your home country.

[Coasian Inc.](https://www.coasian.com/) is a Delaware C corp because I want the option to go public in the future.
