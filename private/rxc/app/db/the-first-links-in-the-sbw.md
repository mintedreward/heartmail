The Social Bitcoin Web (SBW) is a new social network where everybody is a sovereign individual. The following individuals have agreed to be linked from my personal web page to begin building the SBW.

[Brad Meinert](https://bigbadbrad.com). Growth Hacker.

[Will Townsend](https://will.townsend.io). I'm a human being who writes software, enjoys music, and lives in Vancouver BC ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.

[Sebastian Vanti](https://sebastianvanti.com) es un artista chileno - holandÃ©s.

[Kurt Wuckert Jr.](https://kurtwuckertjr.com) Bitcoin Historian. Fighter. Family Man.

[Ryan Wold](https://www.ryanwold.net). I'm grateful to be a son, husband, and father.

[Framore](http://framore.net). This site is how I believe the internet should be: not the products of big corporations but various sites curated by each user.

[Stephan M. February](https://february.sg). Bitcoin developer.

[Bryan Daugherty](https://bryandaugherty.net). Technology solution consultant.

[Diddy Wheldon](https://www.diddywheldon.co.uk). Actress, Artist, B.Msc., BSV.

[Mr Z](https://mrz1818.com). "The majority see the obstacles; the few see the objectives; history records the successes of the latter, while oblivion is the reward of the former."

[Vegard Wikeby](https://vegardwikeby.com). I help businesses with getting their online business profitable.

[Kris Arsov](https://www.arsov.bg/). I'm a Salesforce Commerce Cloud Engineer at 5 PM Ltd.

The SBW is based on the web, Bitcoin, and social networks. It uses new extensions to [paymail](https://www.bsvalias.org) to make a true market of information. It is just getting started. To join the network, purchase a domain name for yourself, set up a personal web page, and get linked into it.
