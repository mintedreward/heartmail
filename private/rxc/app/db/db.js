Every individual can own their own domain name, their own website, their own email, and their own interoperable social media app. I am not selling the SBW as a service. I am doing it myself and showing others what I do.\n\nToday I'm happy to announce that I have launched the first version of my personal social media app, eponymously titled Ryan X. Charles, which is available in the app store for iPhone and the play store for Android. It is also available on the web at [ryanxcharles.com](https://www.ryanxcharles.com).\n\nI don't think everyone in the world is going to download Ryan X. Charles. Instead, they will download the apps of their loved ones, friends, and colleagues. Some of them will create their own apps. Others will be happy to have an account hosted by a business they trust.\n\nEach app will have the option of adopting SBW protocols for things such as articles, images, and video. Content can be re-shared from one app to another. The SBW cannot be censored because popular content will be widely distributed.\n\nThis is how a social network should be. It is not owned by one person or corporation. It is a protocol that anyone can adopt with no central point of failure. It is a reflection of the true social network, which are the people you are actually connected to in life.\n\nI will be giving away the source code to this app for free to help more people become sovereign. My goal is to become connected to the 150 strongest sovereign individuals in the world who share my values of Truth, Love, & Beauty.\n\nPlease open my app or visit my web page from time to time for updates.","metadata":{"title":"Download Ryan X. Charles in the App Store","author":"ryan@ryanxcharles.com","date":"2021-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":"article"},"date":1636675200000,"filename":"introducing-rxc.md"},{"content":"\nI had over 26,000 followers on Twitter and could easily get attention by tweeting something. However, Twitter made me feel disgusting every time I opened it up. Even though I tried only to look at my own profile, they put advertisements for other tweets that I don't want to see everywhere. I found it very easy to click through and start viewing other people's tweets on Twitter. It is psychologically addictive and hard to look away. However, I gained nothing and only cringed every time I looked at it. I even fell for a scam in the past week and had to do an hour's worth of research to convince myself it was just a scam and calm down. The scam was just a website promoting a false claim in order to get clicks to scam advertisers. How irritating.\n\nTwitter does not promote the truth. Twitter promotes whatever creates engagement. What Twitter promotes is false about 50% of the time. It is completely unreliable as a way to learn about what is going on in the world. I do not agree with Twitter's principles and do not want to continue to harm my own psychology by using it. Furthermore, even though I stand a lot to gain by putting advertisements for my work on there, I do not want to continue to promote Twitter itself by advertising my work with it, because it forces other people to look at Twitter just to see what I am up to. The only ethical thing to do is to delete my profile and to stop promoting it completely.\n\nI know a small number of people have bookmarked my personal web page and will see this message. All new updates will be on my personal home page first, and on other social platforms second. Please come back from time to time to see new content and see what I am up to.\n\nI am serious about the Social Bitcoin Web (SBW). It is bigger than you think. I will publish more technical information soon. Please get your personal web page going. I am going to monitor the previously mentioned links for updates. Let's link to each other and build a better web where we are all in control over our own identity and content.\n\nIf you want to contact me, my email address is my first name at my personal domain name dot com.","metadata":{"title":"Why I Deleted My Twitter Account","author":"ryan@ryanxcharles.com","date":"2021-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":"article"},"date":1636329600000,"filename":"why-i-deleted-my-twitter-account.md"},{"content":"      \nIf you are going to engage with other people in business, sometimes things go wrong. When they go wrong, corporations enable you to limit liability.\n\nImagine you provide a service like a hosted Bitcoin wallet. You take every precaution to secure your users' funds. Unfortunately, one day your service is hacked, and your users' funds are stolen.\n\nSo long as you followed the law at every step, your users can sue your corporation for their funds, but they cannot sue you personally. This means while your corporation may go bankrupt in order to pay out to your users, you do not personally go bankrupt. This is the entire reason why corporations exist.\n\nCreating a corporation is not expensive. Every person in the world who engages with others economically has every reason to create a corporation. Even if you are an employee of someone else's corporation, you may have other business interests outside of your employer and you should create a corporation for all your business activity.\n\nBest practices for creating a corporation depend on what country you live in and where you do business. For US companies that intend to go public, you should create a Delaware C corp. For US corporations that do not want to go public and want to minimize taxes, you should use an LLC, and you should research which state is best for you. You do not have to incorporate in the same state where you live, but you do need to register there. For outside the US, there are countless options. You do not necessarily need to incorporate in your home country, but you likely need to register in your home country.\n\n[Coasian Inc.](https://www.coasian.com/) is a Delaware C corp because I want the option to go public in the future.","metadata":{"title":"The Purpose and Value of Corporations","author":"ryan@ryanxcharles.com","date":"2021-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":"article"},"date":1636243200000,"filename":"the-purpose-and-value-of-corporations.md"},{"content":"      \nThe Social Bitcoin Web (SBW) is a new social network where everybody is a sovereign individual.

This makes it possible to have a true market of information. The economics-first model fixes many issues, most especially the subversive misallocation of attention caused by the overreliance on ad-funded media (social and traditional). We will fix the attention issue first. Then we will fix every other issue.\n\nWeâ€™re going to build the Social Bitcoin Web together publicly on social media. Big Tech companies like Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), Twitter, and so on, will be able to follow along and pivot their business models over time. But our network will have many opportunities to outcompete them if we can move faster than they do.\n\nStep 1. **Buy a domain name for yourself**. Your domain name should have a TLD corresponding to your country. If you live in Spain, your domain name should be [yourname].es, for instance.\n\nStep 2. **Host a personal web page on your domain name that you fully control and that serves as the entry point to your public persona**. You donâ€™t have to share everything about your private life. Just share the information you want. Take pride in your personal web page. This is your new profile (not your Instagram).\n\nYou should be able to get these things going in one day. If youâ€™re busy, no more than one week. Remember you can iterate. The first version doesnâ€™t have to be perfect. You can make it better tomorrow.\n\nMy domain name is [ryanxcharles.com](https://www.ryanxcharles.com/). Bookmark my web page.
