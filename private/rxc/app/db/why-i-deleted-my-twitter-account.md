I had over 26,000 followers on Twitter and could easily get attention by tweeting something. However, Twitter made me feel disgusting every time I opened it up. Even though I tried only to look at my own profile, they put advertisements for other tweets that I don't want to see everywhere. I found it very easy to click through and start viewing other people's tweets on Twitter. It is psychologically addictive and hard to look away. However, I gained nothing and only cringed every time I looked at it. I even fell for a scam in the past week and had to do an hour's worth of research to convince myself it was just a scam and calm down. The scam was just a website promoting a false claim in order to get clicks to scam advertisers. How irritating.

Twitter does not promote the truth. Twitter promotes whatever creates engagement. What Twitter promotes is false about 50% of the time. It is completely unreliable as a way to learn about what is going on in the world. I do not agree with Twitter's principles and do not want to continue to harm my own psychology by using it. Furthermore, even though I stand a lot to gain by putting advertisements for my work on there, I do not want to continue to promote Twitter itself by advertising my work with it, because it forces other people to look at Twitter just to see what I am up to. The only ethical thing to do is to delete my profile and to stop promoting it completely.
