The **Social Bitcoin Web (SBW)** is a set of protocol extensions to Paymail, Bitcoin, and the Web that connects real-world identity (private by default, of course) to electronic cash payments over the internet. This makes it possible to have a true market of information. The economics-first model fixes many issues, most especially the subversive misallocation of attention caused by the overreliance on ad-funded media (social and traditional). We will fix the attention issue first. Then we will fix every other issue.

We’re going to build the Social Bitcoin Web together publicly on social media. Big Tech companies like Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), Twitter, and so on, will be able to follow along and pivot their business models over time. But our network will have many opportunities to outcompete them if we can move faster than they do.

Step 1. **Buy a domain name for yourself**. Your domain name should have a TLD corresponding to your country. If you live in Spain, your domain name should be [yourname].es, for instance.

Step 2. **Host a personal web page on your domain name that you fully control and that serves as the entry point to your public persona**. You don’t have to share everything about your private life. Just share the information you want. Take pride in your personal web page. This is your new profile (not your Instagram).

You should be able to get these things going in one day. If you’re busy, no more than one week. Remember you can iterate. The first version doesn’t have to be perfect. You can make it better tomorrow.
