The **Social Bitcoin Web (SBW)** is a social network of sovereign individuals. Every individual can own their own domain name, their own website, their own email, and their own interoperable social media app. I am not selling the SBW as a service. I am doing it myself and showing others what I do.

Today I'm happy to announce that I have launched the first version of my personal social media app, eponymously titled Ryan X. Charles, which is available in the app store for iPhone and the play store for Android. It is also available on the web at [ryanxcharles.com](https://www.ryanxcharles.com).

I don't think everyone in the world is going to download Ryan X. Charles. Instead, they will download the apps of their loved ones, friends, and colleagues. Some of them will create their own apps. Others will be happy to have an account hosted by a business they trust.

Each app will have the option of adopting SBW protocols for things such as articles, images, and video. Content can be re-shared from one app to another. The SBW cannot be censored because popular content will be widely distributed.

This is how a social network should be. It is not owned by one person or corporation. It is a protocol that anyone can adopt with no central point of failure. It is a reflection of the true social network, which are the people you are actually connected to in life.

I will be giving away the source code to this app for free to help more people become sovereign. My goal is to become connected to the 150 strongest sovereign individuals in the world who share my values of Truth, Love, & Beauty. Stay tuned. Please open my app or visit my web page from time to time for updates.
