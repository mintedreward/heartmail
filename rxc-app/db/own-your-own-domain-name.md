I discovered David Turner this morning who has made reasonable arguments COVID but whose Twitter account with 25,000 followers has been deleted with no recourse. It seems he has been deplatformed by Twitter because his arguments don't fit the mainstream narrative.

I recommend perusing his content available on [davidturner.com](http://www.davidturner.com) and arriving at your own opinion about whether it was the right call for Twitter to delete his profile. In my opinion this is obviously an abuse of Twitter's central position in society and a sign that we need to migrate everything off of Twitter and all other hyper-centralized social platforms (Google and Facebook) as quickly as possible.

David owns his own domain name, davidturner.com, which means it's very difficult to fully censor him. Although Twitter has deleted his account, which comes at a great cost, his voice cannot be wiped out so long as he has alternatives.

The domain name system (DNS) is administered by [ICANN](https://www.icann.org) and [IANA](https://www.iana.org). Although technically centralized, DNS is actually widely distributed because many different organizations and countries control all of the top-level domains (TLDs) like .uk, .es, and .com. [IANA has a list of all the organizations that administer each TLD on their website](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db). It is interesting to browse through that list. Compare that list of organizations with Twitter. DNS vs. Twitter is massively distributed vs. highly centralized.

You can use a registrar like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com) or [Godaddy](https://www.godaddy.com) to register a domain name. It is a good idea to register a domain name using a TLD that is in your country (like .uk for the UK and .es for Spain) and using a registrar that is located in your country. By relying on your country you guarantee that you have some say in the ownership of the domain name and it is unlikely a foreign adversary will ever be able to take it away. If you want to hedge against your own country, then you can buy a second domain name in a different country.

You will also need to get a website and email going at your domain name. I recommend [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.com) as the simplest way to get a website going, and [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com), [Microsoft Exchange](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/compare-all-microsoft-365-business-products-b), or [Amazon WorkMail](https://aws.amazon.com/workmail/) for email hosting. But as with domain registrars, it is best to do your own research and find service providers in your own country.

If you get your own personal website going at your own domain name, you can email me at ryan@ryanxcharles.com and I will give you a link on my [friends](https://www.ryanxcharles.com/friends) page.
