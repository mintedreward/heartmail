[Paymail](https://www.bsvalias.org) is an extension to email that enables the use of cryptographic algorithms for authentication, encryption, and messaging. Paymail addresses are the same thing as email addresses. You can have [yourname]@[yourdomain]. The primary purpose of paymail is to serve as [infrastructure for SPV wallets](https://powping.com/posts/ef72d7cb5e0ce6a7457dffc79f9c17e791cc50d18f049d5e89736c624d805a04), however it can be extended to solve every problem related to identity.

A paymail has two parts:

* Alias: This is the "name" or "local part" of the paymail: [yourname]
* Domain: This is the domain part of the paymail: [yourdomain]

I have decided to start using a top-level paymail for myself and my organizations. This is a paymail where the alias, or name, is an empty string. The paymail [@ryanxcharles.com](https://www.ryanxcharles.com) is my primary paymail. The paymail ryan@ryanxcharles.com is an alias that also serves as my email address.

Using a top-level paymail allows shorter paymails and makes sense for sovereign individuals and organizations who have a primary identity associated with a domain name. Since I own my own domain name, and my domain name is my name, I can use the paymail [@ryanxcharles.com](https://www.ryanxcharles.com) in the same way that some people use Twitter or Instagram handles, except that I properly own my own domain name rather than donating my soul to a social media organization that I don't agree with.

Meanwhile, my primary corporation is called [@coasian.com](https://www.coasian.com).
