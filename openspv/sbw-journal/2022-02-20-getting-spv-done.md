Dear Social Bitcoin Web Consortium Member,

The goal of the Social Bitcoin Web (SBW) is to build all the protocols and software we need to make our businesses interoperable with social features such as identity and content, Bitcoin and tokens, and the web.

The most significant portion of this initiative is to get interoperable SPV wallets going for each of us as quickly as possible. Identity is the most important early piece to get this working, so that is where we are starting.

In our first meeting last week we accomplished several things:

- We decided to use GitHub and most members have already signed up at github.com/openspv. If you are not on this already, please contact me. There is already a repository there including the draft license.

- We decided to use MetaNet.ICU private channel #openspv for chat. If you are not already signed up for that, please contact Joel Dalais <joel@dalais.org>.

- We established five working groups: Group 1 (big picture), Group 2 (media / DRM), Group 3 (payments), Group 4 (identity), Group 5 (DHTs), Group 6 (UI/UX). You can join as many groups as you want. Group 1 always encompasses all of them as all protocols must be modular, consistent and interoperable.

The call is recorded here:

Our next meeting is tomorrow at 4pm PT. You should already have an invite. The second meeting is offset by 8 hours from the first to make sure people in Asia and Australasia have a chance to join this one. If you do not have an invite, please contact Diddy Wheldon <diddy@heartmail.com>.

As mentioned, the meetings will toggle by 8 hours every week to make sure everyone can join at least once every two weeks. If possible, you should join every meeting because we will not rehash content. If you cannot make a meeting, you can watch the recording to know what happened.

The theme of the meeting will be:

- Conscious communication: We are bringing together many competing businesses to work together cooperatively. It is important we continue to improve our communication to minimize conflict and maximize productivity.

- The license: This is necessary to get everyone on the same page about contributing and using IP. The license is designed to be open within the consortium but closed without. Please read the actual text of the license found in the LICENSE file of the repository. We will need everyone to agree to this, or suggest agreeable changes, before we can contribute substantial IP.

- Protocol and software roadmap: We will be starting with basic identity features as this is a prerequisite for nearly everything else. We are aiming to produce an MVP that allows interoperable SPV wallets to trade Bitcoin and content by April.

- Organizing working groups: The purpose of the working groups are to allow people to concentrate only on the areas they care about and ignore the others. You can be a member of all working groups if you want.

The meeting will be recorded and made available to all consortium members.

I look forward to talking with you all and making another step towards our goal :)
